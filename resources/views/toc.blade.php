                                        We will only make changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they
                                        are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of
                                        your interests.</li>
                                    <li>We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) within the
                                        time prescribed by law before we make changes to these Terms and give you an
                                        opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are
                                        required by law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them
                                        if you continue to use our Products.</li>
                                    <li>We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to
                                        our updated Terms and no longer want to use our product, you can deactivate your
                                        account at any time.</li>

                                        Terms or Policies, including in particular our data policy/terms and conditions,
                                        we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also
                                        suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people&#8217;s
                                        intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal
                                        reasons.</li>
                                    <li>Where we take such action, we&#8217;ll let you know and explain any options you
                                        have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal
                                        liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the
                                        integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we
                                        are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from
                                        doing so for legal reasons.</li>
                                    <li>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an
                                        agreement between you and us, but some other provisions will be in place.</li>

                                    <li>We cannot predict when issues may arise with our Products. Accordingly, our

                                    <li>These Terms and conditions/ Data policy make up the entire agreement between you

                                        prior agreements.</li>
                                    <li>Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental Terms. If
                                        you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and
                                        will become part of our agreement with you. To the extent that any supplemental
                                        Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the
                                        extent of the conflict.</li>
                                    <li>If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining
                                        portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these
                                        Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these

                                    <li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights
                                        and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with

                                    <li>You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in
                                        certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it
                                        appears unrelated to the name that you use in everyday life). We will inform you
                                        in advance if we have to do this and explain why.</li>
